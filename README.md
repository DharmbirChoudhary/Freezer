# DatBase

*Note:* this branch is a dead end, but maybe educational to see how easy it is 
to model the database as a value on top of git.

Inspired by / ripped off from Rich Hickey's talk, [The Database as a Value](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Datomic-Database-Value) and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com), DatBase is a lame attempt at the idea of the database as a value in Objective-C.

## Should I use this?

[Nooooooooope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJXYMDu6dpY). It's slow, poorly-designed, and almost certain to lose and destroy everything you love. Just don't.
